"You're going to have to pay for a revision if you want one! I did what you told me to do, so why would you want one!?" These are not the words you want to hear from your designer at the end of a project.

Unless you can communicate effectively with your designer, you will be unhappy with the design work produced. This statement has many repurcussions. The main lesson to take from it is that one person's favorite designer may be another's most disliked.

To put it another way, pre-bid discussions are very important. 

This does not mean that skill is immaterial. What it means is that to make the greatest use of your designer's skill, the two of you must be able to communicate well. This means that you should have an in person or phone / Skype discussion with your website designer before you commit to a project with them. During such a conversation, you get the chance to determine whether the two of you will be able to understand each other.

In other words, you're taking a big risk if you decide to ask for a bid through and online form, get an answer by email, and sign a contract without any real discussions.

During your pre-bid discussion there are several important points to cover. If this is going to be your first website, some of these items may not be self evident, so read on:

The main goal is to properly define the scope of the design, or what you expect to be done, the time frame, and style of the work. 
<ul>
	<li>During the project, how can you contact the web designer (phone, im, email, etc.)?</li>
	<li>Will the work be subcontracted?</li>
	<li>How many revisions are you allowed?</li>
	<li>Scope of the project: In other words what is the designer responsible for, and what are you responsible for. Do you need to provide conent? graphics? logo?</li>
	<li>Deadlines and check-ins</li>
</ul>
