Unless you are writing in binary, there's layers of abstraction between you and the computer. This is good, since
computers can understand strings of ones and zeros, but you can't. Abstractions are just shortcuts, broad brush strokes,
short handles for long strings of ones and zeros.

Leaky abstractions.

Variables, scope, functions
