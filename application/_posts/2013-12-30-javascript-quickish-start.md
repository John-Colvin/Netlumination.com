This is a quick guide to get up and running with JavaScript. It'll cover some of the basics so that you can get to a
point where you're able to read JavaScript and understand the general gist of what's going on. Hopefully this means
you'll be able to contribute to existing projects and write some of your own.

I'm assuming you can google and will be finding supplementary references as desired. You can follow along using
[jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net). A great JavaScript languages reference is the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

Since this guide is geared toward developers, we will be covering setting up a development and testing environment in
addition to details about the JavaScript language itself.

As I write the guide, I'll post the individual parts. Below is a table of contents:

### Table of Contents
* [Functions: use and reference](../javascript-functions-use-and-reference)
* [Scope: an introduction](../javascript-scope-introduction)

_This guide is meant to be an introduction to quickly get you up and running. The guide is meant to be read from beginning
to end if you are not familiar with JavaScript at all. If you have some familiarity with JavaScript, you can use the
table of contents to jump to the sections you'd like to find out more about. Please let me know if I've missed anything
important or if you have suggestions. Pull requests are always welcomed._
