Making a 2d JavaScript game engine

My first gaming experience was Hunt The Wumpus on a Texas Instruments 99. But what I really sunk a lot of time into was the original Nintendo. My favorite was Metroid, then Kid Icarus. I never had any of the later Nintendos, but I did play quite a bit of The Lost Vikings on NesTicle. Platform games always fascinated me... the huge map (seeing the full Metroid map with the secret worlds was somehow mesmerizing), the slowly scrolling gameplay, the cumulative experience, slowly working toward one far off goal through a labyrinthine guantlet.

So out of some vague sense
