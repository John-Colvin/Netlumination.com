Adding multiple sidebars to your Wordpress site is simpler than the results of many Google searches would currently have you believe. The advice in those sites will still work, but you'd only want to follow the advice if you like extra work. I'm all in favor of a good workout, but I'd rather do it somewhere else.

The extra work I refer to is created, since the function that makes adding multiple sidebars simple is <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_sidebars"><code>register_sidebars()</code></a>. Many Wordpress tutorials only show how to use the singular form <code>register_sidebar()</code>.

Here is the three step process of including multiple sidebars and widgets on your Wordpress site using register_sidbars():
<ol>
	<li>Open up functions.php (this file is found under ...[YOUR THEME]... , where you substitute [YOUR THEME] for the name of your theme. Find where there is a section that includes register_sidebar() or register_sidebars(). Here is what it looks like in twenty_ten and the old default theme:</li>
	<li>Replace that section of code with:</li>
	<li>Now go to your admin panel and navigate to Appearance &gt;&gt; Widgets, and you should be able to see all your sidebars. You can simply drag and drop widgets into them.</li>
	<li>Wherever you want to add a sidebar within your theme, simple add code that looks like this:</li>
</ol>
