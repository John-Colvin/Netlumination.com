Logo for <a title="Web Design and Development Services" href="http://netlumination.com" name="netlumination">Netlumination LLC, Web Design and Development</a>:

<img class="size-full wp-image-121 alignleft" title="netlumination" src="http://netlumination.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/netlumination1.png" alt="Logo for Netlumination Web Design" width="285" height="67" />
This logo has to represent a wide variety of things, since this site is for web design and development, some graphic design, and business identity consulting. The lines of the lettering are sleek and modern like web business itself. The sun is an integral part of the logo. The sun brings a feeling of energy, light, and warmth to the logo.

Logo for the <a href="http://www.scitechy.com/" name="scitechy">SciTechy science and technology blog</a>:

<img src="http://netlumination.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/scitechy-little.png" alt="scitechy-little" title="scitechy-little" width="196" height="138" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-510" />This is a logo for a science and technology blog. The images in the logo are directly related to the subject of the blog, and they are a natural pair. The planet represents science, the satellite represents technology, and the two are linked by an orbit with the lettering in between. The lettering itself is a sans serif font, with clean and clear lines. The font is meant to tie in with the feeling people associate with science and technology.

Logo for the <a name="marinelayer">old Marinelayer Science Blog</a>:

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-120" title="marinelayer-logo" src="http://www.netlumination.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/marinelayer-logo1.gif" alt="marinelayer-logo" width="461" height="104" />This design is influenced by the domain name. A blue cloud by itself doesn't immediately bring to mind a marinelayer, but a cloud in combination with a lighthouse does. The lettering is very rounded, so that it goes along with the theme of the domain name.

Logo for the <a href="http://www.slugophile.org/" name="slugophile">Guanacaste Nudibranch Project</a>:

The logo includes the initials of the research program and an image of the study organism.

I designed the icons used on this website. They had to be small and yet suggest an illusion of three dimensions:
