Evergreen Icesports was a complete site makeover. The look of the site had to be updated, and a Content Management System (Wordpress) was used to give more control to the site owners.

Herb 'n Gourmet was a major site redesign. The goals were to make the site look more professional and make the site contents easilly editable by the site owner. To these ends, I created a custom WordPress theme.

<div class="site-info">

I designed Stock.Netlumination.com to draw attention to the photos that are displayed on the site. As such, it is presented with a simple and unobtrusive layout. I added customized content management to this site, so the photographer can easily upload new photos and information about them. The website automatically creates the thumbnails and stores and displays information about the photos. A blog entry is automatically created each time a photo and a description are uploaded. This makes the maintenance of the site stress free.

The unobtrusive layout of this site did not stop me from adding necessary functionality. Where the photos were taken can be viewed using a Google Maps application. So a simple layout doesn't have to mean no extras.

<div class="site-info">

SciTechy is a science and technology blog. The design of the site enhances the ability of a reader to find content they find interesting. On the right hand side of each page, near where the browsers scroll bar is, is a tag cloud, where the reader can click on a subject of interest. The content articles visually separated from the navigation to make it easy to find what's important.

This site also has a custom content management system that I developed for the author. Posts can be added and edited through the content management system, allowing the author to concentrate on creating content and not editing HTML.

<div class="site-info">

Slugophile is a page that presents the work done by a biological research group. The site displays and organizes a large amount of biological information. There are several different categories of page, so it was essential to create a uniform feel for each page, independent of category. This was done by clearly dividing each page into 3 parts. The top of each page has the navigation, the left side has photographs or illustrations, and the right side has explanations. Like this, a visitor can quickly glance at any page in any category and quickly extract the information that is important to them, without having to reacquaint themselves with a new layout.
