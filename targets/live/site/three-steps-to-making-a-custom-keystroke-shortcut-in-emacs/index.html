                        This one's short (ish?) and sweet. It describes how to make your own global key bindings for functions of your choice in Emacs.
<ol>
	<li>Type "C-h b" in Emacs. This will bring up a list of all the current keybindings.</li>
	<li>Type "C-s [KEYBINDING YOU WANT WRITTEN OUT]" to double check that the shortcut isn't taken using search. For example to check that "C-c t" isn't taken type "C-s C-c t".</li>
	<li>Modify your .emacs.d/init.el file like this
<ol>
	<li>
<pre>;; [USEFUL COMMENTS]</pre>
</li>
	<li>
<pre>(global-set-key (kbd "[KEYSTROKES WRITTEN OUT]") '[FUNCTION NAME])</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
For example to set C-c g to trigger goto-line:
<ol>
	<li>
<pre>;; Define C-c g as a shortcut for goto-line.</pre>
</li>
	<li>
<pre>(global-set-key (kbd "C-c g") 'goto-line)</pre>
</li>
</ol>
That's all there is to it. A little bit more about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rebinding.html">setting key binding in the GNU Emacs Manual</a>.

If you want to use a key that you don't know the code of simply press, "C-c h [KEY OF INTEREST]". For example "C-c h [F5]" shows: " is undefined", so I would use (kbd "&lt;f5&gt;")

Ok, that's it, you don't have to read the rest. The rest is just the usual quagmire  associated with most things in Emacs.

A side note is that there are multiple ways of refering to keybindings in emacs. In this example, I make use of the kbd macro. The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-Rebinding.html">kbd macro converts keystrokes written out using M-, C-, etc. into a form that can be passed as an argument to global-set-key.</a> Instead of using kbd, you can also write out your keystroke combinations using a Lisp string. This will only work , "for ASCII characters and Meta-modified ASCII characters."
<ol>
	<li>
<pre>;; Alternate definition of C-c g as a shortcut for goto-line using Lisp strings.</pre>
</li>
	<li>
<pre>(global-set-key "\C-cg" 'goto-line)</pre>
</li>
</ol>
Finally, you can use a Lisp vector. Vectors are written in square brackets, and characters in vectors are written with a question mark and slash in front of them.
<ol>
	<li>
<pre>;; Alternate definition of C-c g as a shortcut for goto-line using Lisp vectors.</pre>
</li>
	<li>
<pre>(global-set-key [?\C-c ?\g] 'goto-line)</pre>
</li>
</ol>
I usually try the kbd method first, since it will usually work. You can use array to make use of strange keytrokes. Simply type C-q and the keystroke you're interested in to insert the code for it.

For example, if we type C-q C-c we get ^C, and C-q g gives simply g, so the example above can also be written like:
<ol>
	<li>
<pre>;; Another alternate definition of C-c g as a shortcut for goto-line using Lisp vectors.</pre>
</li>
	<li>
<pre>(global-set-key [?^C ?g] 'goto-line)</pre>
</li>
</ol>
I have to say, that there are some keystrokes whose codes I have trouble getting emacs to understand this way, but using "C-c h" and kbd will usually do the trick. There's certain keys you won't be able to use. For example if you're on a Windows system and you hit the Windows key while using Emacs in a terminal, you'll get the Start menu on Windows instead of  a keystroke sent to Emacs.
