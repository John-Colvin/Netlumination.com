I quickly mentioned recursion in <a href="http://netlumination.com/blog/quick-note-on-recursion">my previous post</a>. Turning digits into letters is clearly another example for which recursion is useful. Think about a number like 524. If you know that 4 = "four", 5 = "five",  and that 20 = "twenty" then all you have to do, to turn 524 into words,  is run your script on 5, add "hundred," run your script on 20, and run your script on 4, and if you write your script well, then you can do this using recursion.

Take a look at a working example of <a href="http://peter-ajtai.com/examples/numbers.php">the function I wrote</a> to do just this with PHP.
