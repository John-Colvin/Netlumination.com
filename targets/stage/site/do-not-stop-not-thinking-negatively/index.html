                <p>Have you ever run across a variable called something like <code>undisable</code>? It takes some mental lifting to turn it into
<code>enable</code>. The conversion from something into its negation is almost like removing a layer of abstraction.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it&#39;s usually clearer to write <code>if something</code> than it is to write <code>if not something</code>. Of course, there
are times you don&#39;t have a choice - you have to use <code>not</code>. But the other day I ran across a case where I didn&#39;t
immediately realize I had a choice. I caught myself staring at something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="nx">previouslyCached</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="nx">linked</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">methodA</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">methodB</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I was looking at this piece of code because a path was dropping into the wrong fork. The two <code>not</code>s do not help, and in
this case, the <code>or</code> gets in the way too.</p>

<p>Is this clearer?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">previouslyCached</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nx">linked</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">methodB</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">methodA</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The two code snippets above are logically equivalent. They accomplish the same thing, but I think the second one is much
easier to read.</p>

<p>Removing the <code>not</code>s makes it clearer, and in this case, switching to <code>and</code> makes it clearer. There are
four cases we are concerned with: one of the variables is true while the other is false (2 possibilities for this one),
both are true, or both are false. With the first <code>if</code>, the <code>or</code> is capturing three of these possibilities, with the
second snippet - the <code>and</code> - we are only capturing one. In this case specificity means clarity. It&#39;s easier to imagine
both <code>previouslyCached</code> and <code>linked</code> being true then it is to imagine the either one or both of the opposites of
<code>previouslyCached</code> or <code>linked</code> being true. The <code>else</code> acts as a natural &quot;catch all&quot; in the second snippet, while it acts
as a strangely specific and narrow filter in the second one.</p>
