                <h2>Not much help, but there is truth in advertising</h2>
                <p>I got an email saying that lost laptops are recovered 3% of the time. The email promised to increase the chances of recovery by 80 whole percents! Well, at least there is still truth in advertising?</p>

<p>So that would be:</p>

<pre><code>0.03 + (0.03 * 0.80) = 5.4%</code></pre>

<p>So, 5.4% recovery.</p>

<p>In other words, increasing the chances of recovery of your laptop by 80% from 3% means you&#8217;ll get your laptop back 5.4% of the time&#8230;. superb&#8230;.</p>

<pre><code>FBI statistics state that once your laptop is gone, there is a 3% chance of recovery. Increase those odds by installing
Front Door Software today; a system designed to help you recover your laptop as soon as someone turns it on. After
installing FrontDoorSoftware on your laptop by visiting  [A URL], you can sign in and control your program. Here you can
customize your security options which include sending a message to your monitor and creating a lockdown code to protect
your information. This program turns your monitor into an ownership tag and statistics show simply displaying who owns
the laptop increases chances of recovery by 80%.</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: Looking at their homepage, there are some seemingly conflicting numbers, but this may reflect unclear references to  recovery numbers for lost laptops versus stolen laptops.</em></p>
