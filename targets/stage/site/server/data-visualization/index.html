                <p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sleepingtime.org/">Sleeping time</a> is a site with an interesting idea. It takes the time of a
Twitter user&#39;s Tweets, and it makes a guess at their sleep schedule. The idea is that if you&#39;re sleeping, you won&#39;t
Tweet (obviously this only applies to amateur Tweeters). Once you enter a person&#39;s nickname, the site draws out a
visualization of the sleep schedule. For example <a href="http://www.sleepingtime.org/Peter_Ajtai">here is my sleep schedule</a>.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1346" title="Sleep" src="http://img.netlumination.com/sleep.jpg" alt="sleep schedule" width="440" height="256" /></p>

<p>Well, the first impression one gets is that I sleep as much as a
<a href="http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih3/sleep/guide/info-sleep.htm">brown bat</a> (19.9 hours per day
apparently). The red area is much larger than half the clock, so it looks like I sleep the whole day away.</p>

<p>Of course the clock only has 12 hours on it, so while it looks like I sleep 2/3 of the day, I actually only sleep half
of that, or 1/3 of the day, according to Sleeping Time.</p>

<p>So, if the visualization doesn&#39;t give you a quick visual idea of what portion of a day you spend sleeping, what is it
good for? It tells you what portion of half a day you spend sleeping, but that&#39;s not really a metric that&#39;s ingrained
in any of our brains.</p>

<p>This is the problem with data visualization. A graph often looks clear cut and simple, but it is often simply not
showing you an answer to the question your are asking.</p>

<p>If you found this post even mildly interesting, then you should know that a great book about graphs, charts, and other
ways of showing data is
